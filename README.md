# OP Explorer

 A web app to explore Optimism chains.

It's purpose is for me to explore all the pieces of the OP Stack. It's a reason for me to poke into all the functions of the contracts and other things like the format of the `extraData` field, etc. To that end it's scrappy code, written quickly with maximum delegation to AI (especially for the UI & design), and an unsustainable lack of tests. File an issue or submit a PR if you notice something broken.
